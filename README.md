# Aloha Apparel Co. Webpage Project

## The Project

The project consisted on developing a static website homepage for an apparel company. The homepage is divided in different sections based on the initial requirements. 

Following the RWD principles, three breakpoints for the website have been created:

- Mobile (480px)
- Tablet (600px)
- Desktop (1240px)

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Personal Learnings

By starting this project using HTML and CSS I have learnt the basic principles about elements, attributes, how to structure a webpage, the best HTML and CSS practice and its importance to organise and create consistant coding sheets. The importance of Flexbox, its syntaxes, properties and usability was also very important for the developing process of this webpage.
<br>
<br>
A good website has to be responsive. And in order to do that a website has to be as much flexible as possible to adapt on any size of screen, from mobile to desktop. Using the RWD principles I also learnt the importance of making a responsive webpage. Checking grids, layouts, fonts measure systems, images, medias, breakpoints and so on.
<br>
<br>
And last but not least, the introduction to programming throughout these weeks, gave me a basic understanding of how the programming logic works. Based on that I was also able to apply what I have learnt with JavaScript and jQuery on my first project.
